    		<h3>The Gift of Education</h3>
		  	<img src="img/children-81487_640.jpg" alt="old_school"\> 
		  	<div class="text synopsis">
		   		<p>I did not know the gift of education until my own child was not allowed to study with is peers in a public school, and that's when I realized the best gift to a child is the gift of education.  I started this site to share why I believe every child is gifted and therefore his abilities should be respected and catered to.  I'll also share my experiences with my five children, and together, we can all gift to our children student-tailored educations which maximize their abilities. </p>

				<p>Even though it was painful when I was left to find solutions myself when some of my kids who were diagnosed with disabilities were not allowed into public school classrooms, I did not wallow.  Instead, I seek to understand my kids' natural abilities, learning styles and then planned a suitable education for each of them.  As a result, four out of five of my children qualified for respectable universities by fourteen-years-old.</p>

				<p>While on this journey, I learned about existing and unconventional methods of achieving good educations for my children. Post by post, I will tell you how this can be done, as well as where I found help and resources. What appears on this site will comprise about half of what will be published in a book.</p>

				<p>Nobody is a guru, and I have never believed anyone has the ultimate knowledge in anything. I may know a little more because I spent years researching and have personally walked the paths four and half times with my own kids and another thousands of times with my students. Yet, I believe others have much to contribute as well!</p>

   			<h3>Everybody is a Genius</h3>
		  	<img src="img/einstein.jpg" alt="old_school"\> 
	    	<div class="text synopsis">
	    		<p>Most people find it hard to believe that everyone is gifted, only IQ measures how clever we really are, and our potential success in school and career depends on that IQ number.  The fact is, all of us are gifted but in different ways. Einstein said that too.</p>

				<p>You can turn some of us upside down and we still can see things right-side up, but we cannot read as fast and we see things differently. They call us dyslexic, and to think that Leonardo da Vinci was like that.</p>

				<p>Some of us have supersonic sensual abilities and sensitive in hearing, sight, smell and touch, and can detect 10 different musical instrument parts in a piece, taste and smell 5 different ingredients in a dish, or sense the motions of things around us.</p>

				<p>It is therefore hard to sit in a normal school setting since everything is heightened and it becomes hard to function, so they say we have sensory integration disorder, and order us to go for therapies. In that case, Mozart and Gordon Ramsey would have to go for therapies too if they were born in this generation.</p>
				<p>Some of us love to study the links between unrelated things, the mosquitoes and a tsunami, sand and glass, then we ask too many questions and are irrelevant. Just like Einstein who was not accepted in schools and thought to be stupid.</p>

				<p>Since we have a passion for simple topics and study them to the ends, we are aspergers or autistic. Then, most professors in universities are aspergers since they are experts in only very few topics.</p>

				<p>If we were to measure people by just how the schools measure us, then most gifted are ignored and have to grow up thinking we are stupid (I did).</p>

				<p>Academic achievements, standardized and IQ tests cannot be the only means to measure even our own kids. So if you think or were told your child has a disability, then think again.</p>

				<p>In many occasions, I was told my children have disabilities, but I chose to think otherwise. Instead, I went to look deep into their capabilities, focus on developing their self-esteems and motivate them find their dreams and their passions, because going by a standard measurement, they would be failures.</p>

				<p>Interestingly, when they've found their passions, and when they have good self-esteems, they even fair well in standardized tests, which is a bonus. </p>

			<h3>Asian Vs Western Education</h3>
			<img src="img/children-multiracial3.jpg" alt=""/>
	    	<div class="text synopsis">
				<p>Most people tell me that westerners can accept more 'nonsense' and their schools can be panaceas to parents whose children have difficulties in Asian schools. Some people say that Asian schools teach more academically and therefore stretch our children more - I thought so too, until I became a parent to students from both sides.</p>

				<h4>ASIAN AND WESTERN</h4>

				<p>I have always been and still am proud of the education I received, which gave me social mobility, so it was hard for me to believe that there was any good education system apart from the one I was familiar with.</p>

				<p>Therefore, when I moved to another country, I used to think hard and homeschooled my children until I found good schools that met my criteria.</p>

				<p>So far, my children have studied under the Singaporean, Australian, American and Chinese systems, and to be really honest, none is better than the other, and every system has its own merits.</p>

				<h4>ACADEMIC DIFFERENCE</h4>

				<p>The western systems tend to pitch Math and Science at lower levels than the Asian systems, or so I thought. Therefore, I did not really look at their Math syllabus or homework thinking my children should be miles ahead of their peers, until my then12-year-old son came home and asked me about cosine, sine and tangent identities.</p>

				<p>He skipped a few classes to attend courses at the university, so he did not realize his classmates, all twelve, had gone ahead to cover trigonometry. This is not a class from some expensive private school but a primary school just five minutes' walk from home.</p>

				<p>The school fee was  and there was no waiting queue to register the child as the state ensured all students within the catchment get a place. There was no 'gifted class' or 'gifted program' in the school, yet the class of 25 twelve-year-olds were doing trigonometry.(?) I was actually pleasantly surprised.</p>

				<p>During their class time, they also did Japanese, Robotics and History. So instead of mugging for PSLE, these 12-year-olds were getting ready for high school (or secondary school) education in their own ways.</p>

				<p>By the time they left their primary school, they knew simultaneous equations, trigonometry identities, persuasive and descriptive writing, history and geography of their own country.</p>

				<p>It was an inquiry based system where each kid was allowed to explore as deep as he/she desired. I thought... wow...this teacher accelerated all of her students, amidst her busy schedule of writing nice school-leaver reports for each student.</p>

				<h4>DISCIPLINARY DIFFERENCE</h4>

				<p>Afraid that my son could not fit in, I had hoped for more lenient disciplinary requirements from the school, yet my son was assigned to a really strict old English teacher who could not tolerate nonsense: no sweet or soft drinks in the school, everyone should sit upright, no talking with the mouth full, no talking back, no calling out, and no asking questions in class without raising hands.</p>

				<p>So what did she do to ensure orderliness? With a lot of love behind her stern face.</p>

				<p>For two occasions when my son did not behave, she called me in and had my son sit in the office with the VP. They would go through his unacceptable actions with him, allowed him to defend himself to understand his perspectives, and then explain why his actions were not acceptable. It was in these sessions I got to know my son's thoughts better, too.</p>

				<p>As a typical old gentle lady, the teacher would punctuate all her sentences with "Darling", and start her reprimanding with "You may not know it, but..."</p>

				<p>I can still recall the last statement from the VP as we left the room, "I look forward to you putting all these bad behaviors aside and then see your contributions in class.  I know we have great things to learn from you with that wonderful mind of yours."</p>

				<h4>CULTURAL DIFFERENCE</h4>

				<p>When my son ran out to play without a hat, the same teacher would run after him with one which was usually too small since he was big for his age. </p>

				<p>She was never judgmental.</p>

				<p>Would you believe she made my son functional in the classroom again within three weeks and two meetings. All because my son wanted to please and make her happy, so that the class could continue.</p>

				<p>He knew she cared and he reciprocated. It is therefore a misconception that Westerners are more tolerant and in my son's case, she was less.  However, this educator knew how to handle him calmly.</p>

				<p>I have these educators to thank forever now that my son can attend university and high school classes.</p>

				<h4>COMMON OBJECTIVES BUT DIFFERENT PREMISES</h4>

				<p>How the educators from different cultures handled the same student was starkly different though they wanted to achieve the same thing. I believe it is because they started with different premises: one believed the boy was bad and needed a punishment to 'wake' him up, while the other believed he wanted to be good but didn't know how.</p>

				<p>The latter took three weeks to do what the former could not in years.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, in any part of the world, most of us educators and parents spend too little time knowing who our children are. Not all of our children are the same: some are suitable for screaming at or even a spanking, while others are more suitable for talking to.</p>

				<p>Some thrive on challenges, others don't like repetitive work but think creatively. Yet, both types are gifted and precious in their own ways.</p>

				<p>If we do not label and judge our students so quickly, but give them a chance to show us what make them tick, perhaps we will have a better chance in giving them a great education, and it really does not matter if it is Western or Asian.</p>

			<h3>Visual Spatial Learners </h3>
		  	<img src="img/eye-catcher.jpg" alt="old_school"\>
	    	<div class="text synopsis">
  				<p>Visual spatial learners won't show workings on their Maths papers and derive answers in the strangest ways and methods not taught in schools. They choose to be too creative in their 'creative writing' classes and irk their teachers. Do you have one at home?</p>

				<h4>ADULT VISUAL LEARNERS LEARN TO COMPROMISE</h4>

				<p>Though a spatial learner myself, I find it hard to cope with my kids sometimes. Perhaps it is because we, as adults have been drilled and grilled by our education system to perfection we've forgotten how to solve problems from first principles or from whatever we need to know. We've forgotten that many people possess enough intelligence to build upon what they already know to obtain next level of understanding with little guidance.</p>

				<p>For example, in our Math paper, we get no marks when we do not show the steps that make sense to the teacher/marker, even if our answers are correct, even in the university.</p>

				<p>Since fighting the system is of no use, I asked my oldest son to learn the right steps and forgo HIS own problem solving method. He lost his love for Maths completely in secondary school even though he topped his Primary school in Math. What a fool I was!</p>

				<p>Looking back, he (oldest boy) was the genius, I was just a system follower and I probably helped destroy his love for Math. Fortunately, he found his passion in other areas that I cannot help in.</p>

				<p>These days, I no longer let those few marks determine how my children should think, I let them explore and solve their own ways, then teach them how to present their weird solutions so that others can understand.</p>

				<h4>VISUAL-SPATIAL LEARNERS SEE BIG PICTURES</h4>

				<p>I was watching my other son do his Maths two years ago. I saw that he was heading for the wrong answer, it was crystal clear to me. So I interrupted him to show him the 'right steps' to the answer. Since he is not your regular child, he put up such a big fight I almost lost my lungs shouting at him.</p>

				<p>"Why wouldn't he allow me to show him just one step?" I thought to myself. And, I seldom teach him!!! I wanted some obedience!</p>

				<p>The more I wanted him to just pause, the louder he yelled, and eventually, he cried and kicked up a big fuss and went to the room. Then, I talked myself into letting go of the situation, so I told him to do just what he wanted.</p>

				<p>TO MY BIG SURPRISE, he gave me the right answer using a completely different and shorter method?! He grinned and walked off.</p>

				<p>Since then, I have never meddled with his Math again as I observe him progress from Grade 5 Math to second year university Math in two years. I can no longer guide him, since he chose Math electives that I have never studied.</p>

				<p>I recall this was how he did his work in his younger days: he saw the whole picture in his mind first, then solved everything all at once.</p>

				<h4>DIFFERENT BUT NOT WRONG</h4>

				<p>He had no steps! He'd look at me and ask, "Right? Mummy?" I'd shrug my shoulders, because I wouldn't know. I needed to pick up my pencil and go through the question one step at a time like I was trained to do.</p>

				<p>I could calculate very fast, and go through steps very quickly, but I HAD to go through the steps. If I had not picked up that pencil, I wouldn't know the answers.</p>

				<p>On the other hand, if you ask him to solve the steps one at a time, to communicate what he is doing, he is completely disorientated and he is lost! My job then, was not to force him to comply to the model answer his professors put on the board, but to encourage him to put down his own thoughts so that others can understand.</p>

				<h4>UNDERSTANDING VISUAL LEARNERS</h4>

				<p>It occurs to me, why he had a hard time functioning in classrooms when he was young: teachers had no time to teach each child to present their thoughts, so instead, they taught the kids a method they know all invigilators know and will mark correct.</p>

				<p>Visual students do not see things the way sequential folks do, but they are not wrong either. Often more correct and our task is to help them 'see' like others and present what they see in their minds' eyes so that others can understand.</p>

				<p>I also begin to understand why teachers lost patience with him in his younger days, and why he constantly lost patience with his teachers. He could not understand why his teachers could not 'see'.</p>

				<p>With well-meaning teachers, he could end up like me, adopting the world's wisdom and solving problems step by step, not using my first gift of being able to solve them without those steps.</p>

				<p>Now that I have not used them, I have lost those abilities as well.</p>

				<p>I'm sure there are many of us who learn differently from the prescribed methods dished out by schools. If you have a child, student, friend or sibling who is like that, what are you to do?</p>

				<p>Visual learners are gifted in their own ways, and need to slow down, understand what others see and communicate their thoughts.  Knowing this, would you work with visual learners so that they can learn to communicate their differentiated thoughts, or would you force them to conform and follow the model answers in the hope of helping them achieve A's?</p>
